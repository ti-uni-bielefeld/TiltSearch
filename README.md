# TiltSearch

**TiltSearch** extends the [**WarpingSIMD**](https://github.com/ti-uni-bielefeld/WarpingSIMD) implementation of the MinWarping method. While MinWarping is based on the assumption that both panoramic images share the horizontal image plane, MinWarping with the **TiltSearch** extension allows that one of the panoramic images is captured with a tilted camera (but the projection point still needs to be in the horizontal plane of the other image). **TiltSearch** was written by Christoph Berganski.

See [README.TiltSearchApps.md](README.TiltSearchApps.md) for information about the **TiltSearch** applications and [README.TiltSearchLib.md](README.TiltSearchLib.md) for information about the **TiltSearch** library.
